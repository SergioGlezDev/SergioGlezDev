## My Github Profile
Hello! My name is Sergio, nice to meet you!
I'm glad you came to my GitHub profile, I invite you to stop by and explore my little corner (although I like to call it sergio's little library).

I'm a web developer, although I tend to a more front-end profile, my goal is to be a fullstack developer.

### About me
- 🤗 Don't be afraid to contact me! I would like to meet the developers who visit my profile to make a small networking ecosystem.
- 🎮 I also play games. My favorite game genre is RPG!
- 🐕 I love dogs, they are too cute. If you have a puppy, please drop me a pic!
- 💻 I love tinkering with web development. I will try to upload everything I do in my little library!

I look forward to hearing from you to talk and network. Thank you so much for making it this far!

Best regards
 🙋‍♂️ Sergio
